# Redux & redux toolkit

- State management system for cross component / app wide state.
- Local state ( useState, useReducer )/ cross component state (prop chains / prop drilling ) / app wide state ( eg: Authentication )
- Context as well as redux helps us manage cross component & app wide state easier.
- Disadvantages of context - Complex setup & management. ( enterprise level ) where we have multiple nested wrappers for each providers. (ProviderWrapper hell)
- Context is great for low frequency update like theme / authentication, but not good for data that changes a lot.
- Performance can be affected. Its not a replacement for redux / flux patterns

- Redux is about having One central data store.
- Components subscribe to the store , store notifies when it changes.
- Components request for slices of state. They wont directly manipulate store.
- Its done by reducers. They mutate the store data.
- Reducers should be pure functions
- Components dispatch actions. Its a JS object with a type & optional payload.

```
npm i redux react-redux
npm install --save-dev redux-devtools
```

## Store

- Has getState(), and dispatch(), subscribe()

In store/index.js, we wire up the store

```
import { createStore } from "redux";

// Actions
export const addItem = () => {
  return {
    type: "INCREMENT",
  };
};

export const subtractItem = () => {
  return {
    type: "DECREMENT",
  };
};

// Reducer
const INIT_STATE = {
  counter: 0,
};
const reducer = (state = INIT_STATE, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT": {
      return {
        ...state,
        counter: state.counter + 1,
      };
    }
    case "DECREMENT": {
      return {
        ...state,
        counter: state.counter - 1,
      };
    }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
const store = createStore(reducer);
export default store;

```

To attach the store to app, in index.js, we use the other package `react-redux`
We wrap the root component with Provider just like we did for Context.
We get access to `useStore, useSelect, useDispatch, connect`, from react-redux.

```
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import store from "store/index";

const app = (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
);
ReactDOM.render(app, document.getElementById("root"));

```

Now that we wired up the store, in the component ( option 1 - for class components )

```
import React from "react";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
import { addItem, subtractItem } from "store/index";

const Counter = (props) => {
  const { count, addItem, subtractItem } = props;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1> Count is {count} </h1>
      <button onClick={addItem}> Add </button>
      <button onClick={subtractItem}> Subtract </button>
    </div>
  );
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    count: state.counter,
  };
};

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
  return {
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'increment'})
  }
}
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

// or as a short cut

export default connect(mapStateToProps, { addItem, subtractItem })(Counter);

```

Here, connect is a higher order component.
If we use an ES5 function, then we need to call `this.increment.bind(this)` for event handlers.

Or with new syntax, (option 2) - Here, we use the object syntax. Not the function syntax.

```
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";

const Counter = (props) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  // Subscription is auto managed.
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter);
  const addHandler = () => {
    dispatch({
      type: "INCREMENT",
    });
  };
  const subtractHandler = () => {
    dispatch({
      type: "DECREMENT",
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1> Count is {count} </h1>
      <button onClick={addHandler}> Add </button>
      <button onClick={subtractHandler}> Subtract </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;

```

We can also have a payload where we can pass values to reducer.
And we can use the action.payload to get the passed value.

We can have a selector function along with the reducer and import them to the component.
So we can maintain the same at one place and get them reused.
`const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter)`

We should never mutate the state, but create a copy and update them.
