# What is react ?

- It is a client side JS library for building user interfaces.
- Interactive, smooth & feels like a mobile app. Things happen instantly. Great reactive UX.
- Traditional websites/ apps - round trips & was slow. ( request / response cycle ).
- JS runs logic in browser. It manipulates DOM.
- We dont need to fetch new HTML pages. Instead, we can use JS to make them dynamic.
- Building complex interfaces easy.

## Why do we need react ?

- With just javascript, its imperative. We need to program them step by step.
- We need something declarative.
- React will be used to split the app into small simple components.
- We say what we need to see in a declarative manner, and the library take care of the "how" to render them.
- Makes complex rich interface development easier.

## Single Page Apps:

- It will only have one single HTML. We wont request a second page.
- We need to install 3rd party libs - Router, Testing, API calls, State management etc ( community packages )
- Its a lean component based UI library / framework'ish.
- The focus is more on the "component" concepts.
- Vue = mix of angular & react.
