# Asynchronous

- Reducers are pure, side effect free, and synchronous.
- Old state & action as input, new state as output. Its predictable. 
- To have side effects & async tasks, we can either put them inside useEffect from within component, or within action creators.
- So cannot have side effects there.
- If we install redux dev tools, we can inspect the state
- When we use createAsyncThunk, inside the reducers, we an get different states
  like fullfilled, rejected etc.
  Lets have a users slice

```
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { createSelector } from "reselect";

export const fetchAllUsers = createAsyncThunk(
  "users/fetchAllUsers",
  async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users");
    const responseData = await response.json();
    return responseData;
  }
);

const INIT_STATE = {
  data: [],
  page: 0,
  per_page: 0,
  total_pages: 0,
};

export const usersSlice = createSlice({
  name: "users",
  initialState: INIT_STATE,
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: {
    [fetchAllUsers.fulfilled]: (state, action) => {
      const { data, page, per_page, total_pages } = action.payload;
      state.data = data;
      state.page = page;
      state.per_page = per_page;
      state.total_pages = total_pages;
    },
  },
});

// Selectors
const usersRootSlice = (state) => state.users;
export const getAllUsers = createSelector(
  usersRootSlice,
  (users) => users.data
);

export default usersSlice.reducer;
```

In store.js, add the slice.

```
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterSlice";
import usersSlice from "./usersSlice";

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    users: usersSlice,
  },
});
```

And to use them within the component

```
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { getAllUsers, fetchAllUsers } from "../store/usersSlice";

const Users = (props) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const users = useSelector(getAllUsers);

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchAllUsers());
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1> Users </h1>
      <ul>
        {users.length &&
          users.map((user) => {
            return (
              <li key={user.id}>
                {user.first_name} {user.last_name}
              </li>
            );
          })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Users;
```

## Where do we put the logic?

- Can be done inside the component, or with action creators.
- If code is synchronous, we can do them within reducers preferrably.
- For side effects, always prefer action creators or components.
  A thunk is a function that can delay the action to be sent later.
  With redux toolkit, thunk is built in.

- Install redux dev tools from chrome
