# Features

- Component driven UI is embraced by react.
- Interactive & Scalable UI.

## What are components ?

- React simplifies complex, interactive & reactive User intrerface development.
- React is all about components.
- All UI in the end is made up of a bunch of components. ( HTML + CSS + JS ).
- Its about one concept in its core.
- Reusable, reactive components & seperation of concerns, small code base.
- Functions help to split code into smaller manageable pieces.
- Declarative approach. We just describe the "what". The "how" is taken care of by React itself, ie rendering the same in real DOM.

- Single responsibility principle.
- DRY, Declarative, functions are split into smaller pieces.
- That concept is taken and adapted to make web applications ( spa )
- we can create app-header, app-footer
- HTML + CSS + JS inside components in a declarative manner.
- We define the desired target state & let react figure out how to render the same in real DOM. ie, UI is a function of state.
- We need Node so that the create-react-app runs to build the setup for us.
- Development environment + server `npm start`
- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
- React code is just javascript code. We can use JSX syntax.
- Our code (es6 features, imports, etc is not understood by browsers by default ) is transformed by the workflow.
- index.js is the starting point of the application.
- A component is just a function that returns JSX.
- We can add a css/scss

## Installation

- We need Node js to be installed. Its a runtime for JS.
- `npx create-react-app <proj-name>` and then `cd` into the project.
- `npm i` and then `npm start`
- The tooling & webpack need node.
- package.json has all dependencies. react / react dom is 2 different dependencies.
- index.js is executed initially by React when localhost:3000 is loaded.
- We can import css as well as custom components like `<App />` and it works out of the box.
- we write code in certain way, but the setup make sure it works across browsers.
- Note: React is just javascript.
- we see css imported inside js
- webpack workflow takes care of everything.
- react and react-dom are two packages.
- `index.html` has an id of root which is targeted in index.js
- From within the function, we return HTML, aka JSX. Components usually start with Caps.
- We built our own custom Components with react.


```
- App is a component, and we instantiate them via <App />
- App is the root.
```

## JSX

- We just set thge desired state, its React that figures out a way to render the same in real DOM.
- Javascript XML ie HTML inside Javascript.
- We build our own custom HTML elements , react is all about Components.
- HTMLish ( htmlFor, className, etc )
- We should return one root element from within a JSX.
- Need a wrapper / Fragment
- Always keep the JSX lean.
- We get to write code which is easier to write & manage,& also, works across browsers.
- We should have one component returning from a component. ( That's a rule! )
- We can use Fragment.
- We just set the state, and let react render the UI as per the state.

## Custom component

- shortcut = `rafce` or `rcc` or we have its ES5 function equivalent.
- Add components in a `/components` folder
- Component in react is just a JS function ( special fn that returns JSX )
- Custom components must start with uppercase. ( Thats a rule! )

### Create a new component

- To add styling, we can add css or scss files. Just import `./something.css`;
- We use `className` instead of `class`
- We need to tell the build process to consider these extensions.
- We can have interpolation with `{expression}` and pass data into the component via `props` aka properties.
- From parent to child, we pass down a `prop`. From ComponentA -> Component B -> Component C
- We compose components to create more complex components.
- We have containers & components. Also, shared, layouts etc can be specific folders.
- We need to use `props.children` to make it a wrapper component.

In `src/assets`, place the image that we referred above.

_Earlier, we needed to import React everywhere. But moving forward, we dont need them. Though its okay to put them if we like._

Note, component need an uppercase starting character to distinguish the same from regular HTML components.

- We can pass input as props / children.
- For looping through a collection, we can use map.
- For rendering items conditionally, we can use && or ternary.
- We can compose components by splitting them and using them together to build more complex structures.
- Babeljs can be used to show the conversions. 
- Enable line wrap & react for the site
- We always create one element but in turn contains other child elements.
```
function hello() {
  return <div>Hello world!</div>;
}
```
- JSX gets converted into `React.createElement()` calls. Use babel to see transformation.
- We need one element as the root element that needs to be returned.

## File organizations

- Use craco config if we need to.

```
Can have /components folder , /utils folder , /shared or /ui folder or /layout folders
```

Check babel to see how the code is getting transformed to native React.createElement calls.
And this accept one element as the input, so we need a root element always.
